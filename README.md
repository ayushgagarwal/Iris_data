# Iris_data
This is the Iris data set which I have obtained from Kaggle. The kaggle website said that one species out of the 3 are linearly seperable.

Therefore, in this project, I have found that species and seperated it from the remaining two with an accurancy of 100%

I converted one of the species into the other just to have 2 seperate species. These two were not linearly seperable and hence they were combined to differentiate it from the 3rd species.
repl={"Species":{"Iris-versicolor":"Iris-virginica"}}

Moreover, I have done a number of visualizations using Tableau and I have uploaded the file for the same. That file will only open using Tableau.
